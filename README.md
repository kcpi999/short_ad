This is yii2 project.
It gives you an idea of how to create short internet addresses, just like goo.gl and other services.

-------

Deploy:

    0. Clone repo.
    1. All dependencies should be installed via Composer.
    2. Load db_dump__.sql file into an existing database (`short_ad` by default).
    3. Set everything in config/db.php 
    4. Do the rest of regular deploy stuff, because nothin but nginx + php-fpm or apache2 needed here.
